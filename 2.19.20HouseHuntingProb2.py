#In ps1b.py, copy your solution to Part A (as we are going to reuse much of that machinery).  Modify
#your program to include the following
#1. Have the user input a semi-annual salary raise semi_annual_raise (as a decimal percentage)
#2. After the 6th month, increase your salary by that percentage.  Do the same after the 12
#th
#th
#month, the 18  month, and so on. 
#Write a program to calculate how many months it will take you save up enough money for a down
#payment.  LIke before, assume that your investments earn a return of r = 0.04 (or 4%) and the
#required down payment percentage is 0.25 (or 25%).  Have the user enter the following variables:
#1. The starting annual salary (annual_salary)
#2
#2. The percentage of salary to be saved (portion_saved)
#3. The cost of your dream home (total_cost)
#4. The semiÂ­annual salary raise (semi_annual_raise)
